# Ionospheric Bubble Probability Visualization

A web-based dashboard for visualizing the probability of ionospheric bubble occurrence using spatial and temporal inputs. This tool aims to support researchers, engineers, and operators in satellite communication, GNSS, and space weather monitoring by offering an intuitive interface for analyzing ionospheric disturbances.

## 🌐 Website Purpose

Ionospheric bubbles are plasma depletions in the Earth's ionosphere that can degrade or disrupt radio signals. This dashboard provides a dynamic visualization of the **probability of occurrence** based on key geophysical parameters such as:

- Day of Year (DOY)
- Geographic Longitude
- Solar Radio Flux (F10.7 Index)
- Local Time

## 📊 Features

- Interactive heatmaps and charts for bubble occurrence probability
- Input sliders or dropdowns for geophysical parameters
- Real-time or historical model outputs
- Responsive UI optimized for desktop and mobile
- Supports batch inputs and downloadable results

## 🧪 Data & Models

This visualization uses data derived from empirical or machine learning models trained on:
- Satellite observations (e.g., SWARM)
- Ground-based GNSS scintillation data
- F10.7 solar flux indices and seasonal information

_Model outputs are probabilistic and intended for research and situational awareness purposes._
